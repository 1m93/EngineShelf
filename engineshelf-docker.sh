# EngineShelf - Docker edition (macOS / Linux)
#
# Runs the Linux x86_64 build of a browser inside a container and shows its
# desktop in a tab of your normal browser.
#
# All four engines, and why a container earns its gigabyte differs for each.
# Chromium, because it never goes through Rosetta and so inherits neither of the
# crashes Rosetta causes on Apple Silicon. Edge, because the enterprise feed that
# serves mac and Windows keeps about six months while the Linux package pool has
# kept every build since 2021 - for an old Edge this is the only way in at all.
# WebKit, because Playwright pins a different revision for older macOS releases
# and deletes what it no longer needs: r1860 (WebKit 16.4) is still published for
# Linux and has no macOS archive. Firefox, because one desktop that runs all four
# is worth more than four ways to run three.
