"""EngineShelf GUI backend (macOS / Linux).

Serves the static page in this directory and a small JSON API. All real work -
install, launch, remove, reset - is delegated to engineshelf.sh, so the GUI and
the command line cannot drift apart. State (what is installed, how big it is) is
read straight off disk, which is cheap and needs no subprocess.

Bound to 127.0.0.1 and gated on a per-run token, so a web page you happen to have
open cannot drive your browser installs.

The manager is its own window, not a page that outlives you: closing it stops
this server, the browsers it launched and the containers it brought up. See
"lifetime" below for how the window and the server keep track of each other.
