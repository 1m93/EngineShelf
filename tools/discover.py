"""Build the shelf from each vendor's own live index. No version is hardcoded.

The old tools/refresh-catalog.py carried a MILESTONES list, which meant the shelf
only grew when somebody edited a Python file. Four engines make that untenable:
Firefox alone has shipped 158 majors. So nothing here names a version. Each
engine has an index its vendor publishes, every index carries release dates, and
the shelf is derived from those dates by one rule:

    one version per engine per year - the newest that shipped in that year.

That rule stays correct forever without anyone touching this file.

    python3 tools/discover.py                 # print the shelf, by year
    python3 tools/discover.py --tsv           # emit catalog rows to stdout
    python3 tools/discover.py --write         # merge those rows into catalog.tsv
    python3 tools/discover.py --from 2017     # earliest year to include

Each engine degrades on its own: one vendor being unreachable costs that column,
not the run.
