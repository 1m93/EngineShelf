# EngineShelf code-obfuscation helpers.
#
# Sourced by tools/release.sh. Every function rewrites a *staged copy* of a file
# in place - never a source file in the repo.
#
# What "obfuscate" can and cannot mean here: these are interpreted scripts, so
# the interpreter always needs the source. Encoding it stops casual reading and
# makes the shipped file unpleasant to pick apart, but a determined reader can
# always decode it. This is deterrence, not protection.
#
# Techniques by language:
#   bash        gzip+base64 the body, run it through `eval`. The leading comment
#               header is kept verbatim, because engineshelf-docker.sh prints
#               its own header as help, and because ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} still
#               resolves to the wrapper under eval, so SCRIPT_DIR keeps working.
#   python      zlib+base64 the body, run it through exec() with __file__ set, so
#               modules that locate siblings via __file__ keep working. Version
#               independent, unlike a .pyc.
#   powershell  nothing, by default. Both paths here are opt-in: --ps-strip for
#               the comment strip, --ps-heavy for a gzip+base64 scriptblock
#               wrapper (written but UNTESTED on a machine without PowerShell).
#               Windows Defender reads a .ps1 through AMSI before PowerShell
#               compiles it, and what it reads is the shipped text, not ours -
#               so the build is the last place that gets to decide how that text
#               looks. A stripped file is denser, has no prose left to say what
#               it is doing, and is the only copy of EngineShelf that has ever
#               been refused as malicious. Six shipped .ps1 files are worth less
#               to an attacker than they are to the machine that has to be
#               persuaded to run them.
#   web         html/css/js get comments and indentation stripped. Newlines are
#               kept so JavaScript automatic-semicolon-insertion cannot break.
