EngineShelf - how to open (macOS)

1. Unzip this file (double-click it in Finder).
2. Double-click EngineShelf.app.
   Optional: drag it into your Applications folder first.

First time only - "unidentified developer"?
  macOS blocks apps not signed with a paid Apple certificate. Right-click
  (or Control-click) EngineShelf.app -> Open -> Open. Just once.

If the app bounces and asks for file access:
  When the folder sits in Documents, Desktop or Downloads, allow EngineShelf
  under System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Files and Folders, or move the
  folder somewhere else.

The manager needs Python 3 (it comes with: xcode-select --install).
To stop it: close the window it opens.

EngineShelf - how to open (Windows)

1. Unzip this folder (right-click the .zip -> Extract All).
2. Double-click EngineShelf.bat.
   A window opens and starts the manager. Close it to stop.

Want a Desktop / Start Menu icon?
  Right-click Create-Shortcut.ps1 -> Run with PowerShell (once).

Antivirus says "this script contains malicious content"?
  It is a false positive, and EngineShelf.bat will now say so and tell you
  this instead of showing you a wall of red. The manager opens a port on
  127.0.0.1 and starts PowerShell children, which is most of what a backdoor
  does, so a scanner can read it the wrong way. To allow it, in PowerShell
  as Administrator:

      Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "<this folder>\app"

  Or report it at https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission. The command
  line does not go through the manager and may run as it is:

      app\engineshelf.ps1 run 74

Windows warns about the download?
  EngineShelf.bat is a short, readable script - open it in Notepad - that
  only starts the manager; there is no program to trust. A "Run anyway?" prompt
  is normal for any downloaded script without a paid certificate. If a file
  feels stuck, open PowerShell in this folder and unblock everything:

      Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File

  (or right-click each file -> Properties -> Unblock).

Uses the PowerShell that ships with Windows 10/11 - nothing to install.
