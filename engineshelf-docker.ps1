  The other three engines.

  WebKit is addressed by Playwright revision, which is platform-independent, so
  it only has to be looked up in the shelf. Firefox and Edge are addressed by
  version and need a download URL, which is resolved through lib/engines.ps1
  with the platform forced to Linux - the same code and the same pool listing the
  native launcher uses, so the two cannot disagree about which file is version 114.

  Worth saying plainly why Edge is here: the enterprise feed that serves mac and
  Windows holds about six months, so natively this host cannot reach Edge 114 or
  95 at any price. The Linux apt pool has kept every .deb since 2021. For an old
  Edge this image is not an alternative, it is the only route.

  Firefox's Linux tarball.

  lib/engines.ps1 cannot answer this: it only ever builds the Windows URL,

  lib/engines.sh tries, in the same order. Mozilla moved from bzip2 to xz partway

<#
  Edge's Linux .deb, from the apt pool.

  This is the whole reason an Edge container exists.

  Microsoft's enterprise feed serves all three, and holds about six months: 26
  mac builds, 36 Windows, 27 Linux at the time of writing. What it serves each is
  not the same kind of thing. The mac artifact is a .pkg and the Linux ones are
  .deb and .rpm - archives, which a launcher can expand. The Windows artifact is
  an .msi that installs no files of its own: no File table at all, a 12-byte
  Component table, and a 258 MB Binary stream whose first two bytes are MZ - the
  Chromium installer, run by a custom action. `msiexec /a` therefore extracts
  nothing, and there is no archive of Edge for Windows anywhere in the feed.

  So lib/engines.ps1 gives Edge no Windows platform, and that is correct. It is
  worth spelling out because the reason written here used to be "the download URL
  carries a per-file GUID", which is not it - the feed hands that URL out in its
  own JSON, and lib/engines.sh follows it happily for the mac .pkg.

  The apt pool has kept every .deb since 2021 at a URL that can be constructed, so
  this is the only route to an old Edge from any host.
